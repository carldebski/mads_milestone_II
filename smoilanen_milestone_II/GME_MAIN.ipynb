I want my kids to look forward to pizza Friday, and those class parties the teachers would throw.

It really made me sit down and think about why I put all of my extra cash in GME... I have spent a significant portion of my life in financial scarcity. I am a pediatric nurse, I love my patients and I love my job. I pay more to live close to my job because where I want to live (my hometown) is a 45 minute commute to and from work and after working a 13 hour shift it’s just too hard to drive that far. I always joke about buying a Tesla so one day I can live in my hometown close to my family and friends and let my car drive me to and from work - I just wanna keep working my dream job and live close to home.

      "I'm sure I don't have to be the one to tell you that we have seen a very large uptick in manipulative activity after Friday. Once again it seems like we are getting hammered over the weekend, though now the efforts seem to be more complicated then just trying to paper-hand people. While I have no scholastic credentials that makes me any more of an expert then you all, I have paid witness to countless manipulative behaviors over the course of the past four years thanks to the turbulent Trump presidency and recent election. There are a lot of similarities in the way things were pushed then and the way things are being pushed now. So I figured I would outline some of the things that I've picked up on over the years so you can improve your critical thinking and approach these bots/shills/trolls from a point of strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*PLEASE NOTE, this post is not and will not be political. I simply mentioned the whole Trump thing to show that this manipulative behavior is not new on reddit. This GME situation is not and has never been political, and I completely respect that members of both political parties have come out in support of us retail investors during this whole situation.\\*\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 1: Also a quick note. Please understand that we very well could have manipulation on both sides of the narrative. Don't allow yourself to assume the people posting stuff you want to hear are acting in good faith. Be ever vigilant, because while we want to make sure we are calling out FUD, we don't want this sub to become a prohibitive echo chamber. Always approach situations with logic first, get emotional about things after.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 2: Just another quick note since I forgot to mention it before. Reddit is great because it allows for user moderation in place of direct mod action. While I admire and respect the job that the current mods are doing, remember they are only human. You have a lot of power in dealing with these malicious actors yourself just by downvoting. Don't leave everything to the mods because in the time it takes to get the post taken down and/or the user banned there could have been multiple people that have seen the problem post; And that allows shit to spread.\n",

      "&#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Look for Obvious Appeals to Emotion.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an easy one to start out with. The GME situation right now is built upon a solid foundation of data and information that has been collected, shared, and scrutinized by multiple parties. For a lot of these malicious actors, the intent is to move the focus away from those strong foundations to get you thinking emotionally. Thinking emotionally inhibits your ability to see things logically and can help create doubt on things that you would otherwise be very confident about. Gaslighting is an example of this sort of play, its meant to get you second guessing the things that you were so sure about before. Because if you start second guessing your confidence in the data, you have a higher chance of second guessing the people giving that data which breeds uncertainy and distrust. What the ultimate goal of these comments is, I'm not sure. I'm sure a lot of it is to try and get people to sell, but in my opinion I think there is this deliberate effort to try and paint us all as uncaring people.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these, I recommend everyone to downvote them if it appears that they are injecting emotion into a thread or situation that didn't really call for it. Examples of this include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- \"You all are heartless for getting people's hopes up\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- \"People are out here betting their life savings, won't you think of those poor souls?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- \"The markets going to crash, people are going to lose their retirement funds\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think the commenter is acting in good faith or make good points, by all means engage with them. But make sure to keep yourself centered and don't allow yourself to get baited into saying something that they want you to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads me to my next one...\n",

      "* **Understand That Most Aren't Talking to You**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a big one that I think more people need to become aware of. For someone who uses reddit a lot, its easy to get into this idea that your comment threads and discussions are just between you and the person you are talking with. And you would be right, assuming you were dealing with someone who was acting in good faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oftentimes bots/shills/trolls are not acting in good faith and so they are not really seeing it in the same way as you. For these individuals (Or robots I guess if its a bot), the intent is not to discuss/debate things but to push a message. In a public forum like reddit, everyone's comments and replies are available to see. So a lot of these malicious actors have taken to using that to their advantage by speaking through people in order to push a certain narrative or paint communities in certain ways.\n",

Thats obviously wrong, and you're pissed at them for pushing something so incorrect. So you go into the thread and call them out, which they then respond to your comment basically doubling down and not changing their stance. You can bring up data or examples, but they will always push back, moving the goalposts or pointing to something unrelated. If this sounds familiar to you, its because it is a super common strategy of shills and trolls. They aren't really engaging with you, they are trying to influence the person reading the thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its hard to really grasp sometimes, but for all those that are commenting and engaging in the sub, there are countless number of people that are just lurking and scrolling through all the posts and comments. The name of the game is to try and influence those people, rather then try to convince you that your position is wrong (Bots/shills/trolls can't prove your position is wrong because most of the time they are arguing an intentionally stupid point). You see this all the time in this sub, but here are some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Anytime you see someone pushing a certain phrase or number they are most likely trying to influence lurkers. Stuff like the double-down Monday FUD that was being spread earlier are meant to forcefully thrust something into the public discourse. You can see how the more they were called out on it, the more we saw them change their strategy to continue to push it. Now the thing is to make threads with titles like \"I know Double Down Monday isn't a thing, but...\" or \"Double Down isn't coordination\".  See how even though they present themselves as rational actors, they are taking the time and effort to continue to make the event a thing. Because they aren't focused on convincing us regular users, they are wanting to show people lurking or visiting the sub that we are doing illegal shit. **When we aren't.**\n",

      "Dealing with these can be tricky because you are giving them more chances to push their shit by calling them out in a reply. The best thing to do is to downvote and report, but I would recommend going one step further. If they are going to just talk behind us, then I see no reason why we can't do the same thing. So if I see a comment or thread that I know is someone acting in bad faith, I'll reply to their comment but phrase my comment so that I'm talking to anyone reading the thread.

They most likely didn't have all the info from the get-go and are probably gearing up their questions for the second hearing so that they are more pertinent.

      " I joined GME in January like most of us after WSB's overnight coup and crypto scam surfaced while being infiltrated with unmoderated shills. I had a lot of time on my hands back then before the baby was born - I was hunting down & reading every single piece of DD related to GME, but everything I read was going out the window when shill waves pushed FUD. I never sold but noticed how panic creeps in and I forget all that knowledge. So I started collecting everything that I read to not forget what I learned when FUD kicks in and balance the pros vs the cons during panic. It made a huge difference to my morale on bad days, to the point that I could easily manage to clear the minds of those that were falling for FUD and panicking.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of weeks in, I decided to publish my collection, so I set up the DD list post on rGME and volunteered to moderate through modmail. I was accepted and was absolutely ecstatic to be on the frontline banning HF footsoldiers (plants), shill recruiters, spammers, scammers, harassers, and just straight-up assholes that wanted to trick others. It was enjoyable, not that much of a handful back then, and very very satisfying work. I don’t know if you can understand what it means to protect tens of thousands of users from the shadows, and I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but I felt truly proud of myself for making a difference to the little guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, over the next period of weeks the sub started to change into something very concerning: huge influx of shill accounts, scamming predators luring people through charity groups & spreading FUD about the sub to push users to join their groups, tons of alt accounts (not shills) ready to push a narrative through up/down voting and spamming slightly different comments with the same mentalities meant to convince users that everyone around them is thinking the same thing when it's actually just a handful of assholes with thousands of accounts, OG mods became inactive, and clashes between now ex-mods which leaked out. I'm relieved that so many of you noticed these things for yourselves and shared the info around to others for awareness’s sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a lot of work to combat these growing concerns, and slowly the sub started shifting into something that I'm now not comfortable being a part of. I initially got into this to make sure misinformation doesn't spread and that good DD is vetted, but responsibilities dealing with the rest of these concerns started taking over priority, and it became too much very fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of the last 50 days, along with the insane amount of weight a stay-at-home dad with a fresh newborn has to bear, my willpower was draining, I started losing my temper, I stopped tending to IRL relationships, and put myself in a vicious cycle of self-destruction. In short: I got burned out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following recent events the OG mods decided to finally step in. After they decided to not stay in the loop even though all mods and now ex-mods tried to rope them in continuously through group chats, they were clearly uninformed of the whole situation and put out statements which make it seem like they have a handle of things, when we know they didn’t.  They made changes to the sub which showed that they do not. They reverted keyword-removals that puts the sub in jeopardy such as the r- word, and keywords relating to scams happening right now all across stock subreddits (such as 'decentralized WBS' that surfaced during the Jan coup), and basically reverted the weeks of sweaty work we all put in to protect you guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, one OG mod admitted that they have been in contact with some known suspicious users and have been receiving suggestions on how to operate the sub, and then executing those suggestions. At this point we're unsure if those actions are intentional or innocent, but with other recent events, I personally feel it's in my best interests to cut ties for my own sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’ve made my decision. I'm done swimming against the current and getting nowhere fighting internally only to end up not being able to protect users. I am unhappy with how this sub and other related subs are changing into something which puts retail investors in very vulnerable positions, as we saw what happened with the SEC comments and many other reasons that could potentially lead to these very same subs get investigated for retail investor collusion. Meanwhile, my IRL responsibilities need tending to which takes much of my energy and leaves me drained from being able to keep argumenting in-house to do what is right to the point that I end up wasting the little energy left in me and end up doing barely any needed work. I believe that people with fewer responsibilities than me and more time on their hands can do a better job and I leave it to them.\n",

      "HOWEVER, I am not done fighting against misinformation. I will continue to urge you to read, question, and review everything that **anyone** posts on reddit. I will continue to remind you to make the effort to not fall onto any conclusions before you doubt everything you ever read on any sub. To DD, discuss & cross-review all information yourselves, no matter how trusted you believe the poster to be. There are people here with agendas, who may seem sweet and helpful on the outside, but are sharks on the inside waiting for the right moment to screw you over. However, I will not continue to do any of that on rGME, as I no longer want to be associated with it or any other existing sub related to it which is the home of these very same crooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have decided to open a new sub dedicated to the provision and discussion of **truthful** information related to GameStop stock ($GME) with one cause:\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect all shareholders of GME through education & research meant to put a spotlight on the truth while exposing criminal activity: market manipulation, pump & dump schemes, scams, collusion, FUD, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "I primarily browsed rGME for quality DD and I realized that many people did the same thing and wanted a space free from anything else. It just made sense to separate entertainment from information, and this is what encouraged me to put in the work and set it all up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of being a jack of all trades sub like the rest, our focus is information and discussion. No memes, shitposts, or entertainment posts will be allowed to flood the feed & encourage users to turn their brain off before they scroll to a deep dive post, at which point not having the will to read a page of text and just say \"*meh, fuck it, I’ll just let other users guide me about what to do and believe when info get popular and floods the feed*.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So to combat misinformation and criminal activity the sub is set to post-restricted. What this means is that the public can comment freely, but **submitting a post requires pre-approval by a team of DD reviewers before it is made public.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is to ensure that no published post contains misinformation or unstated speculation so that readers can easily distinguish between hard-fact and theory/opinion. This also makes it easy for mods to identify criminal activity such as market manipulating FUD & scams, thereby safeguarding readers from being tricked with bullshit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DD Vets remain unbiased about the content of any submission during review. We merely ask for evidence to back statements, opinions, and speculation - and when unavailable we ask the author to state the information for what it is. It is clear that the most valuable DD challenges existing viewpoints with new evidence, and the last thing we want is to turn into an echo chamber of confirmation bias.\n",

      "So you're in the market for a new vehicle. You walk into dealership 'A'. A salesperson makes eye contact with you as you enter the showroom. He immediately begins jumping up and down, and starts enthusiastically shouting at you as you timidly scan the vehicles on display. You're taken aback, and feel a sudden sense of apprehension. By now, the salesperson is in your face. He grabs your hand and gives you an aggressive handshake. He asks you what you're in the market for, and you mention a couple of makes/models, including one from a rival manufacturer. This sets the salesperson off, and he starts ranting and raving like a lunatic, listing off all of his perceived arguments as to why you're an idiot for even considering that vehicle. You eventually reach a point where the energy and vibe are too much to handle, so you decide to leave and check out other dealerships. As you walk away, you feel relieved and mentally commit to never returning. \n",

You walk into the showroom, bracing yourself for a barrage from an eager salesperson, but a moment later you realize that this place feels different. You make a lap around the showroom, then an attentive salesperson approaches you to offer help with any questions you might have. You converse for a while, and he does a great job of answering your questions and calming your concerns. He shows you around, takes you on a few test drives, and before you know it, you're driving down the highway in your new vehicle with a big smile on your face. The experience with dealership 'B' was fantastic. Not only did you buy the vehicle, but you felt confident in your decision to do so. You became more knowledgeable about the vehicle and buying process, and you'll likely return to that dealership in the future. \n",

      "I'd like to offer some thoughts on how we can make this sub even better: \n",
      "\n",
      "1) It starts with you, as an individual: Take a few moments before posting to see if someone else has already started a similar post. That post would be a good entry point for a like-minded conversation to take place. If you decide to make a post, pause and give thought to what it has to offer that others haven't already. Mods shouldn't have to babysit this sub all day just to delete numerous posts to ensure relevant/helpful posts attain visibility. I know it's not realistic to expect everyone to remain up to speed with everything that gets posted, but at least take a moment to check the top posts for the last hour/24 hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Mods: This sub is growing fast. It's still small compared to r/wallstreetbets, but I feel that's a good thing. This sub isn't as restrictive and gives more people an opportunity to spread potentially helpful information. Hopefully it stays that way if we can collectively work together to avoid the need for extreme oversight. Please consider a pinned post outlining ways in which people can improve their posts. A guideline of some sort if you will. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Respect: Try to remain respectful when discussing topics on this sub. People have various experience levels with trading/investing and different interpretations of how the markets work and where GME fits into that picture. Remember, there's no such thing as stupid questions, only stupid answers. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Active users and lurkers alike: Your voice matters! Never forget that! If you feel compelled to suggest change, correct misinformation, or point out a different perspective, please feel free to do so. I know it may seem like if you go against the grain, you risk getting downvoted and tarnishing your online appearance, but it might just be worth it. Have the courage to speak up when your inner voice has something to say. There are many intelligent people in this subreddit who can see through the BS and appreciate when someone offers a clear take on a topic being discussed. \n",

I'm sure I don't have to tell you about all the crazy distraction stock stuff that has been spread today. Notice how a VAST majority of the posts discussing this stock are actually calling it out. This is part of their new approach, to go with the grain rather then against it and just sprinkle little bits of FUD here and there in order to gain control of the narrative.\n",
      "      * Let's break down an example. Say for instance you see a post titled something like \"I got banned cause I called out WSB shills on their RKT pumping\". From a glance there isn't anything here that would invoke suspicion, after all we all know WSB is compromised and banning people. And we know that people have been pushing that distraction stock the entire day. However, you have to take a step back and approach it from a different perspective.\n",
      "      * Ask yourself this, if someone genuinely wanted to point out that rocket was obviously a distraction stock what would they do? Would they make another post in new about it after seeing the plethora of other posts already talking about it? Would they include the ticker for the very stock that is being used as a distraction in the title?  The answer is no, because ultimately these things all help rather then hurt the spreading of this new FUD. A distraction is successful when it gets you focusing on something other then what you were focusing on in the first place. If that is the case, if someone was REALLY concerned about this distraction stock, would they actively continue to talk about it and thus continue the distraction?\n",
      "      * We're going to have to start approaching posts in new with a lot more scrutiny. Look past the words being written and try to think about the message those words are sending. And know that we are not dealing with people acting in good faith. Nothing has changed with regards to the nature of the squeeze or GME. Be cautious of those that would suggest otherwise, approach their posts thinking about how they are trying to change your mind. If they are trying to change your mind by actually discussion holes in DD and basing their information on actual data then allow yourself to take their argument into consideration. Anything else, and they are most likely a shill.\n",

I've seen numerous, obvious shills that will use this argument as a means of establishing some sort of credibility to their ridiculous argument. These are actually really easy to deal with, and there are multiple ways to handle jokers like these.\n",
      "      * Remember to simply posts on the basis of what is being writing rather then the person writing it. If someone asks you to go through their post history to prove that their position is not coming from bad faith, it is likely because they are acting in bad faith. When someone gets called out for being a shill, if that person wasn't a shill the easiest way to respond would be to simply bring actual data or evidence to support their argument. If instead they talk past your argument and try to get you to go through their post it just shows further that they have no intention of refuting anything.\n",
      "      * Another thing to keep in mind is that post histories are easily curated and manipulated. If you are a frequent browser of new like myself, I'm sure you've seen the numerous memes and shitposts that get posted throughout the day. Think back to some of the lower effort ones you've seen, ones that really stood out like the poster had spent maybe 5 minutes on it. All of those low effort posts could easily be shills building up a history on the sub so that they can then turn around and use their post history as a way of giving their narratives credibility. NEVER take post history as a way of establishing credibility, it's gamed way too easily.\n",

Regarding the part were we start to grow arrogant, we all saw an increasing in the posts almost celebrating the win when we started to see the news about HF failing. **We didn’t win yet and the war is not done!**  We are **strong united** and guess what they want? **Separate us.**\n",

It was a fabricated fear that I knew better than to believe, but some people took it to heart. More rules started piling on. When you get people to fear something, that's a powerful tool.

Again, I only speak for myself. Other mods or newer mods (however they're decided) may have slightly different things in mind. But positivity first.\n",

      "I am not locking comments as I'm open to hearing what you think the best courses of action are. If you wish to insult or disparage, do it on another r/GME thread. Please don't corrupt the other subreddits I am a part of, that is entirely unfair to them. My chats and private messages are always open. \n",

      " First of all, I am not a shill. I want this board to be able to have a discussion about GME without people being called a shill/spreading FUD whenever they don't blindly comment in favor of the MOASS.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the DD we have read is correct, and I hope it is, shit is going to hit the fan. I was wondering if the government would step in and prevent us from getting the full amount of tendies we deserve and wanted to create a discussion about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of the main arguments is that 1) the government would actually like the MOASS because they would get a lot of tax money, and 2) people all over the world would lose faith in the US market and leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the first point: if the DD we have read is true and the MOASS goes down exactly as we expected it to, is there a chance the impending crash would be so severe that the government would rather forgo the tax money it's going to get in favor of preventing the collapse? I'm not the wrinkliest ape but it seems like everyday I read new DD that uncovers more and more fuckery, and the corruption runs deeper and deeper. To me it is perfectly conceivable that the corruption runs so deep that if the MOASS happened, several systems that prop the U.S. up as a global superpower would fail; the economy has significant impact on almost every other aspect of a civilization. I cannot forsee exactly how this would happen because this is way outside my area of expertise, which is why I want to start a discussion about this. In the case of such a black swan event in which so much collapses, why wouldn't the government intervene?\n",
      "\n",
      "To the second point: yes a lot of people would lose faith in the U.S. market, but would that actually cause a significant number of people to leave the U.S. market though? I am sure quite a number of apes would, but the majority of people invested in the market don't know about the extent of fuckery that goes on, or they don't care. MSM would paint apes as the bad guys as usual, and while a number of people would try and tell the world about the fuckery that just happened, I could see most of it being swept under the rug by MSM + government and things would go on as normal. Most people are busy outside the market; they have jobs and families etc. Would they read up on the fuckery and throw up arms and leave the market, or would they just say \"Yup, government's corrupt, what's new?\" and continue on in the market as normal? Other nations would be caught in a prisoner's dilemma where if one nation decided to withdraw from the U.S. market, the rest of the other nations would continue to prosper. The majority of the other nations would have to come to an agreement to pull out of the U.S. market for it to be fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "***TL;DR***: I want to have a discussion without being immediately dismissed as a shill. If you think my viewpoints are likely wrong, please explain why. If you don't have anything constructive to say, please don't comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the fuckery runs way deeper than we realize and the MOASS would trigger an enormous collapse beyond anything we imagined, would the government forgo the tax money they would get from apes in favor of preventing such a collapse?\n",
      "\n",
      "If the government halts the MOASS before we get the full amount of our tendies, would a significant number of people actually leave the market? MSM/government sweeps things under the rug.

I can't speak to the accuracy of these numbers (perhaps others can chime in) but if accurate, they let us know if a short attack might be imminent, or perhaps when the MOASS is near. When there are no shares left to short, the shorts lose a valuable tool to manipulate the stock.\n",

In a nutshell, every single dollar represented by a new FTD corresponds to a permanent [rise in the average low of the stock price 35 days later](https://i.imgur.com/dymmbEx.png). This can be determined by comparing each day's nominal FTD $ value to the prior day and summing up any increase in value between each day.

      "Two models were needed for price action before and after the January squeeze since the pre-Jan model overestimates the price during and after the March run-up. Neither model predicts the January run up well but other than that, the price follows the models closely. Both equations spike during the March run up and cross on T+35 date 3-1-21 and are joined there to create the floor. Subtracting one standard deviation of around 0.084 creates a floor that the price rarely falls under. Whenever it has, it only did for a week at most before spiking and never falling below that level again. Subtracting two deviations creates a floor that is only ever touched on one day in September 2020. The current -1 deviation level will hit $200 on 7-18-21 and is currently $185 on 7-6-21. The current average price is $223 on 7-6-21 and will be $237 on 7-18-21. Every $52 million in total new FTDS has corresponded to a 10% average price increase with this model since the March run up.\n",

I started digging into the settlement dates and how they sometimes caused massive price spikes with large numbers of FTDs and came up with this. Unlike the exponential trendline where the price is simply following an exponential increase over time, this model tries to explain price movement by the total value of all new FTDs over time. This model has followed the recent price action much closer than the exponential trendline. I'm not sure why the running total value of FTDs reflects in the price so strongly but this model assumes that there is a permanent increase in price with every dollar of new FTD even after it is \"delivered\".\n",

      "Different funds will have different margin requirements when the rocket lifts off, which will cause a cascading effect on everyone who holds a short position plus MMs hedging against options. **When the first fund gets margin called, it'll skyrocket the price by filling every available market and limit order out there**, causing everyone to get margin called **at the exact same time.**\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw this during the first run-up when there were (allegedly) a couple orders filled at $5,000 (I don't actually know if this really happened or not) during that mini-squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but this implies to me that there's going to be more buy orders flooding the market all at once than shares capable of being sold to cover, which means you'll** ***literally*** **be able to name your price regardless of how many zeros you put at the end of it.** \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you and me both own a stock and suddenly there are 50 buy orders that must be filled – if you're offering your 10 shares for $5 and I'm offering my 10 shares for $100k (and no one else holds any) then you're getting $50 and I'm getting $1M. **They'll fill all the sell orders regardless of price** **because they must buy those shares**. \n",

      "Remember the ticker price just shows us the average of the buy and sell orders being filled at any given time. If suddenly there are no more sell orders at $200 and they all turn into $100k, then the ticker will become $100k as soon as the first one is filled. We don't actually have to put up sell orders anywhere near where the ticker price currently is. **We saw this last week when one smooth brained ape bought 10 shares at $440 when the market was trading at $254. That was the price for a fraction of a second and then it averaged down to the rest of the orders.**\n",

      "\n",
      "This also means that the squeeze is going to take **a very long time to unwind** because each time an order is filled for above 10% of previous days close, there will be a 5 or 10 minute circuit breaker. But because there will still be more buys than sells, all you'll have to do is wait in the line to have your billion-dollar order filled. \n",

It is improbable the massive dip was driven from the long side of profit-taking.

And in the second run-up,  people have a higher entry price point and better understand how the short squeeze should play out. With the higher entry point and higher expectation price, the long side investors are less likely to sell their whole position at the current price for profit-taking.

Therefore, doubling down would be their only option at this time. And they had changed their way of shorting the stock instead of keeping the price steady downward. They are letting the price climb and patiently borrowing or even buying some of the shares to dump at once. They know that people would not sell off their shares unless they were convinced that the short squeeze had happened and people are dumping the stock.

If losses and liabilities with respect to such Event Period remain unsatisfied following application of the Corporate Contribution, the Corporation shall allocate such losses and liabilities to Members, subject to the requirements and limitations below.  \n",

      ">Each Member that is a Member on the first day of an Event Period shall be obligated to pay its pro rata share of losses and liabilities arising out of or relating to each Defaulting Member Event (other than a Defaulting Member Event with respect to which it is the Defaulting Member) and each Declared Non-Default Loss Event occurring during the Event Period. Any Member for which the Corporation ceases to act on a non-Business Day, triggering an Event Period that commences on the next Business Day, shall be deemed to be a Member on the first day of that Event Period.  \n",

      ">A loss allocation “round” means a series of loss allocations relating to an Event Period, the aggregate amount of which is limited by the sum of the Loss Allocation Caps of affected Members (a “round cap”). When the aggregate amount of losses allocated in a round equals the round cap, any additional losses relating to the applicable Event  (RULE 4) 46 Period would be allocated in one or more subsequent rounds, in each case subject to a round cap for that round. The Corporation may continue the loss allocation process in successive rounds until all losses from the Event Period are allocated among Members that have not submitted a Loss Allocation Withdrawal Notice in accordance with Section 6 of this Rule.

      ">In the case of a Member default or insolvency, NSCC may cease to act for the Member, and in that event, proceed to close out the open CNS positions of the Member . . . Once NSCC has ceased to act for a participant, its Rules provide it with the authority to promptly close out and manage the positions of a defaulter and to apply the defaulter’s collateral. . . . As the liquidation of a defaulting Member’s portfolio completes (including the sale of collateral used to secure a borrowing), the proceeds from the close-out would be used to repay liquidity borrowings, thus replenishing NSCC’s liquidity resources. Should close-out proceeds be insufficient to fully repay a liquidity borrowing, then NSCC would look to its loss waterfall to repay any outstanding borrowings. (18, 82-83)\n",

This includes any amounts available to NSCC under clearing agency cross-guaranty agreements (agreements with other registered clearing agencies that relate to the guaranty of certain obligations of a common defaulting member, by one or more clearing agency parties to other clearing agency parties). This would include any amounts available to NSCC under the terms and conditions of the Cross-Guaranty Agreement.  \n",

Under this arrangement, no party ever needs to pay “out of pocket” and no party can receive more than its loss.  \n",

Under Rule 4, if there is a loss (i) as a result of an obligation of a defaulting Member to NSCC that was not fully satisfied by the application of its resources or the proceeds from the liquidation of its portfolio, or (ii) due to an event other than a Member default (“non-default loss”, as described in more detail below), NSCC has recourse to the loss allocation waterfall.  \n",

Before the allocation of losses to Members, NSCC would apply 50 percent of its General Business Risk Capital Requirement as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the applicable event period (referred to as the “Corporate Contribution”),or such greater amount as the Board of Directors may determine, to satisfy the losses. The amount of the Corporate Contribution to be applied to any losses arising from events that may occur in subsequent event periods during the next 250 business days would be reduced to the remaining unused portion of contribution, if any.  \n",

      "* NSCC’s liquidity risk management has evolved in order to adhere to regulatory requirements that were adopted after Rule 4(A) was implemented.As part of its efforts to maintain compliance with these requirements, NSCC has continued to strengthen its liquidity risk management strategy, including through growing and diversifying its qualifying liquid resources. In connection with these ongoing efforts, **NSCC is proposing to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day rather than only in connection with Options Expiration Activity Periods**. This proposed change would improve **NSCC’s ability to measure and monitor its daily liquidity exposures and allow it to collect additional qualifying liquid resources from Members whose activity poses the largest liquidity exposure to NSCC in connection with their daily settlement activity, and not only during Options Expiration Activity Periods**. By measuring SLD against Members’ actual daily settlement activity and NSCC’s available qualifying liquid resources, the proposal would also help mitigate risks to NSCC that it is unable to secure adequate default liquidity from other sources in an amount necessary to meet its liquidity needs. **For example, the proposal would help mitigate the risks that could arise if investor demand for the short-term notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program weakens, there is limited investor demand for term debt issued pursuant to a Term Debt Issuance, or NSCC is unable to renew its Line of Credit at the targeted amount.**\n",
      "* (iii) Amended Rule 4(A) and Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits In order to better address the liquidity risks presented by Members’ daily activity, **NSCC is proposing to amend Rule 4(A) to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day rather than only in connection with the monthly expiration of stock options.**\n",
      "* In order to implement this proposed change to the timing of the SLD, NSCC would make a number of changes to Rule 4(A), described below. The **proposed changes to Rule 4(A) would implement a daily calculation and collection of SLD, simplify and clarify the calculations done in connection with the SLD requirements, and enhance the disclosures of the SLD requirements**.\n",

      "DEEP DIVE INTO LANGUAGE:\n",
      "\n",
      "Proposed Daily Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Supplemental Liquidity Providers.\n",
      "   * The proposed approach would no longer require a calculation using NSCC’s available liquid resources on each day in the Lookback Period but would use a simpler approach by looking only at liquidity need\n",
      "* Supplemental Liquidity Obligation\n",
      "   * After NSCC determines the Supplemental Liquidity Providers, NSCC would then determine if any of the Supplemental Liquidity Providers would be required to pay an SLD on that Business Day. The proposed Rule 4(A) would use a simplified calculation by determining if ***the Daily Liquidity Need for each Supplemental Liquidity Provider on that Business Day exceeds the sum of NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources available to NSCC on that day, assuming stressed market conditions*** (described below)\n",
      "   * Because this calculation would be done at the start of each Business Day (as discussed further below), it would be based on the Qualifying Liquid Resources, including Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund, available to NSCC as of the end of the prior Business Day. Additionally, in order to anticipate market conditions that could cause Qualifying Liquid Resources to be unavailable on that day, NSCC would apply stress scenarios in determining its total Qualifying Liquid Resources for purposes of Rule 4(A). \n",
      "   * The proposed change would allow NSCC to **continue to assume stressed markets in its SLD calculations,** ***which protects it against unexpected market events***\n",
      "   * Instead, the Supplemental Liquidity Obligation of a Member would be calculated based on the **actual liquidity exposure that its daily activity would pose to NSCC on that particular day in the event of that Member’s default.**\n",
      "   * Each Supplemental Liquidity Provider that has a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on a Business Day would receive a notice from NSCC of the amount of its Supplemental Liquidity Obligation and would be required to make a deposit in that amount to the Clearing Fund **within one hour of such notice.** The proposed timing of funding a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation would mirror the current requirement that is applied to Members’ Required Fund Deposits, which is also calculated and collected daily, and **must be funded within one hour of demand**. Specifically, NSCC expects to deliver notification of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations to Supplemental Liquidity Providers **by around 8:30 AM ET each Business Day, with deposits required by no later than 9:30 AM ET. (hedgies getting margin called???)** \n",
      "* Proposed Pro Rata Calculation of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations\n",
      "   * In such circumstances, **when multiple Members have relatively large Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of more than $2 billion**, NSCC would have the option to determine if it is appropriate to collect the largest SLD calculated for that Business Day, divided pro rata among the Supplemental Liquidity Providers rather than collect the each of the Supplemental Liquidity Obligations of those firms.\n",
      "* Returns of SLD and Miscellaneous Matters\n",
      "   * NSCC may hold SLD for up to seven Business Days after the end of the applicable Options Expiration Activity Period and may hold SLD funded pursuant to a Special Activity Liquidity Call for up to 90 days after such deposit is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proposed Changes to Rule 4(A)\n",
      "\n",
      "* However, the proposed changes would simplify this section by removing a statement **that specifically identifies two of NSCC’s principal sources of liquidity and would instead more generally refer to NSCC’s sources of liquidity**. The proposed changes to Section 1 of Rule 4(A) would also remove references to options expiration activity periods, which would no longer be applicable to the SLD requirement under this proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First, Section 2 of proposed Rule 4(A) would remove the definition of “Special Activity Calculation Date,” which is tied to the monthly Options Expiration Activity Period, and **instead would use the term “Business Day” throughout proposed Rule 4(A), where appropriate. Business Day is currently defined in Rule 1 as any day on which NSCC is open for business.**\n",
      "2. Second, Section 2 of the proposed Rule 4(A) revise other defined terms that use the phrase “Special Activity” to either remove that phrase or, when appropriate, to replace this phrase with the term “Supplemental.\n",
      "3. Third, the proposed changes to Section 2 of Rule 4(A) would include one defined term for “Qualifying Liquid Resources” to refer to all default liquidity resources available  to NSCC to settle its payment obligations as a central counterparty.  \n",

One paragraph contains a statement that such losses would be satisfied first by applying a Corporate Contribution and then, if necessary, by allocating remaining losses to non-defaulting Participants, in accordance with Rule 4.13 The proposed rule change would add a sentence to the end of this paragraph that would provide that, in addition to the tools described in Rule 4 (which are to be applied when, and in the order, specified in that Rule), DTC may, in extreme circumstances, borrow net credits from Participants secured by collateral of the defaulting Participant.14 DTC believes this additional language is necessary to more clearly set forth the full range of actions and tools DTC may employ in response to such conditions.\n",

      "These revisions are effective immediate upon publishing. Seems to me that after the SEC filing DTC-2021-003 (members submit positions on a regular basis instead of monthly), the DTCC/NSCC is getting scared...\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: another great excerpt:  Section 5.3 (Liquidity Shortfalls) identifies tools that may be used to address foreseeable shortfalls of **DTC’s liquidity resources following a Participant Default**. As described in DTC’s previous proposed rule change adopting the Plan,19 the goal in managing DTC’s liquidity resources is to maximize resource availability in an evolving stress situation, to maintain flexibility in the order and use of sources of liquidity, and to repay any third-party lenders in a timely manner. The proposed rule change would revise the text described below to better clarify and enhance the description of the DTC’s liquidity considerations and the use of its liquidity tools.   \n",

      "\" Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires, in part, that the rules of each of the Clearing Agencies be designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds that are  in the custody or control of each of the Clearing Agencies or for which they are  responsible.11 The investment guidelines and governance procedures set forth in the  Investment Policy are designed to safeguard funds that are in the custody or control of the  Clearing Agencies or for which they are responsible. Such protections include, for  example, following a prudent and conservative investment philosophy that places the highest priority on maximizing liquidity and risk avoidance. The Clearing Agencies  believe the proposed change to consider the size of a bank counterparty in setting its bank  deposit investment limits would allow it to adhere to these guidelines by minimizing the risk posed by smaller counterparties, measured by their shareholders’ equity capital.  Therefore, the Clearing Agencies believe the proposed change would allow the Clearing  Agencies to continue to operate the Investment Policy pursuant to a prudent and  conservative investment philosophy that assures the safeguarding of securities and funds  that are in their custody and control, or for which they are responsible. \"\n",

It's not a dark secret that these hedgefucks and their associates at the top hoard resources and power. Each one of these asshats could literally save and impact hundreds of thousands of people around the world. But do they do that? No, instead they spend it on their fifth vacation house or their second mega-yacht.
